# LO_user

## Introduction

The LO_user repo is my research project for my internship at DMS-Uconn, it contains resources and (modified) codes related to [LiveOcean](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/LiveOcean.html) model validation and output analysis. It is referred to and greatly benefited from the [LO](https://github.com/parkermac/LO) github repo released by [Prof. Parker MacCready](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/) at Univeristy of Washington.
